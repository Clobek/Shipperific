# Shipperific
Created by Team Codarific: Bryce Belock, Jonathan Rhymes.

## About
Shipperific is an application that allows you to search/look up a package that is currently being tracked by a carrier. It will take your input (tracking number/carrier) and return details about your package including location, date, etc. You're also able to sign up/in and save packages you would like to monitor or look back on.

## Font-End Setup
We used a template created by Alex Merced for our initial dependencies/files/folders. We decided to split our workload between front-end and back-end so the front-end was done by Bryce. I used React for the framework (library) and SCSS for styling; everything from hooks to vanilla dom manipulation was used to create this app. When everything in the front-end was finished it was deployed to Netlify.
